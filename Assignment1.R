## You are provided with the Financial Inclusion in Africa dataset, 
## which is hosted on the Zindi platform. https://zindi.africa/competitions/financial-inclusion-in-africa.
## Use the dataset to answer the questions below.

## NB: Please make your work neat by including spaces in the code e.g
## my_df <- df %>% 
##          filter(Age == 35)

##1. At the beginning of the training, we learnt how to tell a story from data.
## List down 5 or more questions that we can ask from the dataset.

##2. Generate a dataset that only contains observations from Kenya. We will 
## use this dataset to answer subsequent questions. Call the dataset Kenya_df.

##3. Drop the "unique_id" and "year" variables from the dataset.

##4. Generate a variable called "household_cat" that re-categorizes the "household
## size" variable into 5 groups. Group 1 (1-5), Group 2 (6-10), Group 3 (11-15),
## Group 4 (>15). 

##5. Generate a variable called "age_cat" that categorizes the "age" variable into three buckets.
## Use limits of your own choice.

##6. Generate a variable called "relationship_with_head2", that combines the 
## "other relative" and "Other non-relatives" options of the "relationship_with_head"
## variable into a single option called "other".

##7. Generate a dataset that contains self employed ladies who have never been married,
## they have no cellphone access, but they have bank accounts. Call this dataset "empowered".
